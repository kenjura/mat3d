This is a proof-of-concept for a Virtual Tabletop using Three.js and vanilla JavaScript.

It's super, duper out of date.

To run, simply host the root file system on a web server. Example:

```
npm i -d http-server
node_modules/.bin/http-server .
```

Then load index.html in the browser. In the above example, load http://localhost:8080/
